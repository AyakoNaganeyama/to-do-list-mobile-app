## Archtecture Diagram

The following show cases how we structured our code. It has 3 layers, a presentation layer consisting of 3 views auth (login/signup), todo list, and details view with all presentation logic housed. the second layer is a business logic that houses signup, login, useTodos which handles all CRUD logic related to the models stored in local storage using ayscneStores to access devices memory for long term storage. The database uses Nosql. We also have a global state which is a domain that access through out the app for tracking the users session interaction, example if logged in or not.

3. **Password validation**:
   Simple validation to check length of password (at least 6 charactors).

   - Please note: that the password is not displayed in the input due to iPhone security and does not allow for password screen shots when password inputs are detected

4. **User validation**:
   You can not create an account if the account exists already. You can not login if there is no such account as well.

7. **Storing todo**:Once the add button is clicked, it will be stored then re-fetched from local storage also executing a validation check to see if it was stored correctly then displayed bellow as a list of todos.

- You can also toggle the tick to show that the todo is complete, this is also updated in local storage for persisting.

9. **Deleting todos**:
   a bin icon that allows users to delete their todos.
   - This will then clear the ui and also remove the todo from the todos list of the logged in user.
